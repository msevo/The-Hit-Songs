    <p style="text-indent: 40px;"> Jive is a digital platform that connects musicians with an audience and helps artists showcase their work in an intimate environment. Jive acts as a digital venue, allowing artists to live stream their performances, accumulating “listeners”, and receive live feedback and donations for their performances.
        Our goal is to create a community of musicians and followers that places the music industry’s emphasis back on the artist.
